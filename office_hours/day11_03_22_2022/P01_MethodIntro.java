    Method --> Function. it is code fragment that we can use again.
    Declaring method
        each method needs to have Access-Modifier, Specifiers, return-Type, methodName(Parameters --> int / double / String / array etc){
    // code fragments
    }
    method type
        * Void type
          main(String[] args) {

    public --> "visible to the world" --> it is accessible in your project classes
    static --> we can call the method without creating Object
               Arrays.toString(); --> this is a static method
    void   --> no return type, it only does the execution, it doesn't give any result.
               Arrays.sort(); --> this is a void method

        * return type  --> we did not learn it yet
